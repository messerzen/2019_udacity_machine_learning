    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, **normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners**. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and  those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "O **primeiro modelo** escolhido é o Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB): Este modelo este modelo pode ser implementado filtros de spam, que pode identificar se um email é span com base nas palavras descrtia neles, ou também utilizado para diagnóstico médico, que prediz com base nos sintomas de um paciente se ele está ou não doente. Este modelo possui como **ponto positivo** seu funcionamento relativamente simples. Além disso,  é rápido de treinar os dados e fazer as predições, além de trabalhar bem com datasets grandes (MULLER; GUIDO, 2017). Este modelo também é menos propício à gerar overfitting, além de raramente exigir ajuste de parâmetros, performando bem com seus hiperparâmetros padrões (Scikit-learn Documentation) .\n",
    "Entretanto, o **ponto negativo** deste modelo é que ele considera que todos as features são independentes, ou seja, uma feature nao afeta a outra. Esta ingenuidade faz com que sua performance seja pior do que os classificadores lineares, como Regressão Logística e Linear SVC (MULLER; GUIDO, 2017). Deste modo, um dos requisitos para aplicar este modelo é que os preditores (features) sejam independentes, o que em muitos casos no mundo real não ocorre, e consequentemente, porporciona a queda de performance citada anteriormente (Gandhi, 2018). \n",
    "**Esta escolha é baseada** na simplicidade do algorítmo e na sua velocidade em operar com datasets relativamente grandes (este com 45222 amostras) tanto no treinamento quanto na predição. Além disso, esse modelo é menos tendencioso a gerar overfitting. A principal característica que levou a escolha deste modelo é que aparentemente, a maioria das features do dataset são independentes (Raça, sexo, estado civil, país nativo), exceto pelo ganho de capital e horas por semana, que aparentemente possuem relação (trabalha mais, ganha mais).\n",

    "O **segundo modelo** escolhido é o Random Forest. Random forest é utilizado em diferentes campos, como bancário, mercado de ações, e-commerce e medicina. Em bancos, este modelo é utilizado para predizer quais clientes que usam os serviços bancários mais frequentemente do que outros e quitarão suas dívidas em tempo. Em finanças é utilizado para detectar o comportamento de uma ação no futuro. Na saúde é utilizado para identificar a combinação correta de todos os componentes em medicina e analizar o histórico médico de um paciente para identificar doenças. No e-commerce é utilizado para determinar quando um cliente vai gostar de um produto ou não (Dongues, 2018). \n",
    "\n",
    "Dentre **os pontos positivos**, este modelo pode ser utilizado tanto para problemas de classificação quanto de regressão. Seu número de hiperparâmetros é relativamente pequeno e são fáceis de entender. Além disso, funcional bem sem o ajuste de hiperparâmetros e não necessita que os dados estejam em uma mesma escala (Muller; Guido, 2017). ALém disso, os modelos de RandomForest permitem medir com facilidade a importância relativa de cada feature, utilizando a ferramente feature_importances do Sklearn. Além disso, RandomForests, assim como DecisionsTree, podem lidar com dados categóricos, contínuos, binários.\n",
    "\n",
    "Por outro lado, um dos **pontos negativos** deste modelo é que se o número de árvores for alto o algorítmo pode ser tornar muito lento e ineficiente para predições em tempo real. No geral estes algorítmos (ensemble) são rapidos para treinar mas um pouco lento para criar as predições. Logo, uma precisão maior requere um número de árvore maior, que resulta em um algoritmo mais lento. Além disso, é praticamente impossível compreender a relação que o modelo cria. Segundo Muller e Guido (2017) random forests tendem a não performar bem em datasets esparsos de grande dimensão (muitas features com valores zero), como dados de texto por exemplo (bag of words).\n",
    "\n",
    "Este modelo foi escolhido devido à sua alta capacidade de criar modelos com alta performance. Além disso, como não há necessidade de criar um modelo de predição em tempo real, não há problema se este modelo levar um tempo maior para treinar e fazer as predições. \n",

    "O terceiro modelo escolhido é o support vector Machine (SVM. Este modelo é frequentemente utilizado ser utilizado em sistemas de reconhecimento de imagens, reconhecimento de caracteres escritos a mão. Dentre os pontos positivos, este modelo é  eficaz em espaços dimensionais elevados, e até mesmo quando o numero de (features) é maior que o número de amostras. É eficiente no uso de memória, dado que usa somente alguns dados de treino para treinar o modelo (vetores de suporte). Versátil, dado que permite o uso de diferentes kernels para a função de decisão.(SciKit-learn documentation).\n",

    "Porém, dentre os pontos negativos, e o número das features é muito maior que o numero de amostras os hyperparametros de kernel e regularização devem ser muito bem ajustados para evitar overfitting (SciKit-learn documentation). Requer que os dados sejam cuidadosamente preprocessado (StandardScaler) e é dificil de compreender o processo de tomada de decisão de um modelo (MULLER; GUIDO, 2017). Pode lidar somente com problemas de classificação binária (duas classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Este modelo foi escolhido primeiramente devido á sua versatilidade, que pode ser feita pelo ajuste de parâmetros do kernel. Além disso, como os dados já estão em uma mesma escala, a necessidade de que os dados estejam em uma mesma escala não é mais um problema para este caso. Apesar de ser bastante lento, neste caso não há problema dado que não é necessário predição em tempo real.\n",

Primeiro, dado ao seu maior F-score (Beta=1) apresentado utilizando os dados de teste. Neste caso, a média harmônica entre a precisão e o recall é levemente superior a 0,6, o que indica que este modelo está conseguindo uma precisão e um recall razoável, ou seja, não há nenhuma medida muito baixa. Apesar de o modelo Support Vector Classifier (SVC) ter um desempenho similar nos dados de teste, o tempo de treinamento e predição é muito superior aos demais, sendo pouco eficiente em relação ao RandomForestClassifier.\n",
    "Quanto à adequadação dos dados ao modelo, temos alguns dados binários binários obtidos por meio das variáveis dummies, e também valores continuos, como idade, ganho de capital, horas por semana. O modelo de RandomForest consegue lidar tranquilamente com dados categóricos, contínuos e binários para criação das árvores. Considerando este conjunto de informações, acredita-se que este modelo seja o mais adequado."

A quantidade máxima de features que cada árvore irá considerar enquanto estiver procurando a melhor divisão é escolhia por meio do parâmetro max_features. Ou seja, se escolhermos max_features = 5 cada árvore irá conter no máximo 5 features, de todas as 103 features que contem no dataset. Dado que estas features são escolhidas de forma aleatória, cada árvore terá um conjunto e sequenciamento diferente de features. A profunidade da árvore (distância entre o nó superior e o nó inferior) é determinada pelo parâmetro max_depth, onde o número de \"folhas\" é 2^ max_depth.\n",

Por exemplo, se três árvores afirmaram que um ponto \"x\" pertence a classe \"a\" e uma ávore predizeu que o ponto \"x\" pertence a classe \"b\", o modelo irá predizer que o ponto \"x\" pertente à classe \"a\". Faz-se a predição dos dados, e mede-se a precisão do modelo.\n",

Se pensarmos em renda = horas de trabalho x remuneração por hora, quando maior quantidade de horas, maior a renda para uma mesma remuneração. De modo similar, a suposição de que quanto maior o nível de educação maior a renda está parcialmente correta, dado que a feature numero de anos que a pessoa passou estudando também está relacionada. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

Aparentemente o ganho foi relativamente pequeno. Entretando, o tempo para o treinamento foi inferior. No caso de datasets grandes, é mais vantajoso trabalhar com um número de features menores, dado que o modelo pode melhorar sua precisão, mesmo que pouco, e melhora sua eficiencia, reduzindo o custo computacional e consequentemente o tempo para treinar o modelo."
